## Utility Example

For currency formatting, prices are displayed in **Naira (â‚¦)** using this helper:

```ts
export function formatNaira(amount: number | string): string {
  const value = Number(amount);
  if (isNaN(value)) return "â‚¦0.00";
  return new Intl.NumberFormat("en-NG", {
    style: "currency",
    currency: "NGN",
    minimumFractionDigits: 2,
  }).format(value);
}
```

**Usage:**
```tsx
<span className="text-gray-400">/ {formatNaira(total)}</span>
```
